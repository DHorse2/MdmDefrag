Commandline
The MyDefrag script interpreter ("c:\Program Files\MyDefrag v4.3.1\MyDefrag.exe") accepts the following commandline parameters. The parameters can also be used with scripts, for example "Weekly.MyD -v C:".

c:\Program Files\MyDefrag v4.3.1\MyDefrag.exe 

Parameter 	    	Description
[-r] FILENAME 	    	Run a MyDefrag script.

    The interpreter will look for the FILENAME in various directories. For more information see the *  RunScript command.
    The "-r" is optional if the filename matches "*.MyD". 

For example:
MyDefrag.exe -r Weekly.MyD
[-m] NAME=VALUE 	    	Set a macro.

    See the *  Macros for more information.
    The DOS commandline has a maximum length, depending on the Windows version, and this puts a cap on the number of commandline macros you can define. MyDefrag itself has no limits to the size, the number, or the content of macros.
    The "-m" is optional, but should be used to prevent clashes with FILENAME and VOLUME. 

For example:
MyDefrag.exe -m SELECT=All
[-v] VOLUME 	    	The volumes to be processed.

    Wildcards "*" and "?" can be used to select a set of volumes.
    Default is to process all volumes.
    This only works if your script uses the *  CommandlineVolumes volumeboolean.
    The "-v" is optional, but should be used to prevent clashes with FILENAME and macros. 

For example:
MyDefrag.exe -v C: -v D:
Weekly -v F:
-d N 	    	Select a debug level. This will control the messages that are written to the debug logfile. The number N is a value from 0 to 6:
0 = Fatal errors.
1 = same as 0 plus warning messages and basic information messages.
2 = same as 1 plus scripting and volume analyasis information messages.
3 = same as 5 plus scripting high-detail information messages.
4 = same as 2 plus moving items information messages.
5 = same as 4 plus moving items high-detail information messages.
6 = same as 5 plus volume analysis high-detail information messages.
For example:
MyDefrag.exe -d 3
Also see: the *  Debug setting.
Note: The debug logfile is highly technical. See the *  #dgh@Z#  Writelogfile and *  #dgh@Z#  Appendlogfile script commands to create a logfile more suitable for users.
