INSTALLER ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Installer commandline parameters

The MyDefrag distribution ("MyDefrag-v4.3.1.exe") accepts the following command line parameters. These can be useful to system administrators, and to other programs calling the setup program.

/SP-

    Disables the This will install... Do you wish to continue? prompt at the beginning of Setup. 

/SILENT, /VERYSILENT

    Instructs Setup to be silent or very silent. When Setup is silent the wizard and the background window are not displayed but the installation progress window is. When a setup is very silent this installation progress window is not displayed. Everything else is normal so for example error messages during installation are displayed and the startup prompt is (if you haven't disabled it with DisableStartupPrompt or the '/SP-' command line option explained above).

    If a restart is necessary and the '/NORESTART' command isn't used (see below) and Setup is silent, it will display a Reboot now? message box. If it's very silent it will reboot without asking. 

/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES

    Instructs Setup to suppress message boxes. Only has an effect when combined with '/SILENT' and '/VERYSILENT'.

    The default response in situations where there's a choice is:

        Yes in a 'Keep newer file?' situation.
        No in a 'File exists, confirm overwrite.' situation.
        Abort in Abort/Retry situations.
        Cancel in Retry/Cancel situations.
        Yes (=continue) in a DiskSpaceWarning/DirExists/DirDoesntExist/NoUninstallWarning/ExitSetupMessage/ConfirmUninstall situation.
        Yes (=restart) in a FinishedRestartMessage/UninstalledAndNeedsRestart situation.

    5 message boxes are not suppressible:

        The About Setup message box.
        The Exit Setup? message box.
        The FileNotInDir2 message box displayed when Setup requires a new disk to be inserted and the disk was not found.
        Any (error) message box displayed before Setup (or Uninstall) could read the command line parameters.
        Any message box displayed by [Code] support function MsgBox.

/LOG

    Causes Setup to create a log file in the user's TEMP directory detailing file installation and [Run] actions taken during the installation process. This can be a helpful debugging aid. For example, if you suspect a file isn't being replaced when you believe it should be (or vice versa), the log file will tell you if the file was really skipped, and why.

    The log file is created with a unique name based on the current date. (It will not overwrite or append to existing files.)

    The information contained in the log file is technical in nature and therefore not intended to be understandable by end users. Nor is it designed to be machine-parseable; the format of the file is subject to change without notice. 

/LOG="filename"

    Same as /LOG, except it allows you to specify a fixed path/filename to use for the log file. If a file with the specified name already exists it will be overwritten. If the file cannot be created, Setup will abort with an error message. 

/NOCANCEL

    Prevents the user from cancelling during the installation process, by disabling the Cancel button and ignoring clicks on the close button. Useful along with '/SILENT' or '/VERYSILENT'. 

/NORESTART

    Instructs Setup not to reboot even if it's necessary. 

/RESTARTEXITCODE=exit code

    Specifies the custom exit code that Setup is to return when a restart is needed. Useful along with '/NORESTART'. Also see Setup Exit Codes. 

/LOADINF="filename"

    Instructs Setup to load the settings from the specified file after having checked the command line. This file can be prepared using the '/SAVEINF=' command as explained below.

    Don't forget to use quotes if the filename contains spaces. 

/SAVEINF="filename"

    Instructs Setup to save installation settings to the specified file.

    Don't forget to use quotes if the filename contains spaces. 

/LANG=language

    Specifies the language to use. language specifies the internal name of the language as specified in a [Languages] section entry.

    When a valid /LANG parameter is used, the Select Language dialog will be suppressed. 

/DIR="x:\dirname"

    Overrides the default directory name displayed on the Select Destination Location wizard page. A fully qualified pathname must be specified. 

/GROUP="folder name"

    Overrides the default folder name displayed on the Select Start Menu Folder wizard page. 

/NOICONS

    Instructs Setup to initially check the Don't create a Start Menu folder check box on the Select Start Menu Folder wizard page. 

/TASKS="comma separated list of task names"

    Specifies a list of tasks that should be initially selected. The following tasks are available: "Associate", "CreateDesktopIcon", "SelectScreenSaver", and "CreateScheduledTask". Only the specified tasks will be selected; the rest will be deselected. Use the /MERGETASKS parameter instead if you want to keep the default set of tasks and only select/deselect some of them.
    Example: /TASKS="Associate,CreateDesktopIcon" 

/MERGETASKS="comma separated list of task names"

    Same as the /TASKS parameter, except that the specified tasks will be merged with the default selected set of tasks. 

UNINSTALLER ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Uninstaller commandline parameters

The MyDefrag distribution ("MyDefrag-v4.3.1.exe") creates a program called "unins000.exe" in the MyDefrag installation directory. This program accepts the following command line parameters. These can be useful to system administrators, and to other programs calling the uninstall program.

/SILENT, /VERYSILENT

    When specified, the uninstaller will not ask the user for startup confirmation or display a message stating that uninstall is complete. Shared files that are no longer in use are deleted automatically without prompting. Any critical error messages will still be shown on the screen. When '/VERYSILENT' is specified, the uninstallation progress window is not displayed.

    If a restart is necessary and the '/NORESTART' command isn't used (see below) and '/VERYSILENT' is specified, the uninstaller will reboot without asking. 

/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES

    Instructs the uninstaller to suppress message boxes. Only has an effect when combined with '/SILENT' and '/VERYSILENT'. See '/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES' in the "Installer commandline parameters" chapter for more details. 

/LOG

    Causes Uninstall to create a log file in the user's TEMP directory detailing file uninstallation and [UninstallRun] actions taken during the uninstallation process. This can be a helpful debugging aid.

    The log file is created with a unique name based on the current date. (It will not overwrite or append to existing files.)

    The information contained in the log file is technical in nature and therefore not intended to be understandable by end users. Nor is it designed to be machine-parseable; the format of the file is subject to change without notice. 

/LOG="filename"

    Same as /LOG, except it allows you to specify a fixed path/filename to use for the log file. If a file with the specified name already exists it will be overwritten. If the file cannot be created, Uninstall will abort with an error message. 

/NORESTART

    Instructs the uninstaller not to reboot even if it's necessary.
