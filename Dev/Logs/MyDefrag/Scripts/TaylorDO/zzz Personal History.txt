Some personal history: me me me...
Used my first terminal at Sir Winston Churhchill Highschool in
South Vancouver, BC, Canada in 1975. 
It was hooked up to the School Board or university; I forget which.

I quit highschool to take programming courses and start a
job where my father's business partner (Bob Connaroe) was
willing to mentor. Many thanks Bob. Mini-computers. 

Then PC client server networks when that developed. I tossed out
the original ISAM DOS source code which is ironic (I need it)
but it turns out B-Tree routines advanced since then. Goodie.
Lots of work with the PICK operating systems on accounting and
billing applications and communications software. Yawn...

Previously: I earned my first dollar (CDN) at Mackie Data
in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1968 at age 7. 
Early career start shredding paper.

I soon after toured the fist ever tape machine and VDU (Display) 
replacing cards and paper tape.

Also various subsequent nameless kids... well... they have names...
