@Rem . TEST2 place value %2 into file name with suffix %1
@Rem . Concept: SET <feature> (<state> OR <state> <value>)
@Rem . 
@Rem . <feature>:
@Rem . 
@Rem . Terms: <attribute> in all cases means: (<attribute> OR <identifier> OR <property>)
@Rem . It really depends on your use case and domain jargon. 
@Rem . IE. It refers to broadly feature identifiers where attributes is the more common use case. 
@Rem . Valid if: 
@Rem . Exists <feature>.CFG (The feature name, alone or as a suffix to Actions, States and attribute values. 
@Rem . Exists <feature><state>.CFG (get set to <value>, if omitted display contents)
@Rem . Exists <feature>_<state>.CFG (set feature to this state, ie ON, OFF, <FeatureAttributeState>)
@Rem . 
@Rem . (<state> OR <state> <value>*):
@Rem .
@Rem . <state>: Text.
@Rem . Usage is by case and may be attributes, options, debug or plugin points, etc. 
@Rem . So these are attributes that you can set for the feature.
@Rem . From another view, features should have a boolean On / Off often.
@Rem . However a feature or module has dozens settings where
@Rem . you will see the most essential implemented here. 
@Rem . More often, you will see code that is external to the companion
@Rem . (calling) application executed at the command prompt.
@Rem . 
@Rem . Feature/attribute settings (SET) are constrained by defined states
@Rem . while allowing the user to (VERY UNSAFELY) enter text/numeric values 
@Rem . where appropiate. Both variations can be valid concurrently.
@Rem . For example PAUSE as a debug setting. 
@Rem . Valid values include ON OFF 0-999* <empty>.
@Rem . 
@Rem . They are controlled the same way as the main feature.
@Rem . By intention, many features
@Rem . 
@Rem . 
@Rem . <value>: Text, not validated currently (which is limited in either case.) 
@Rem . 
@Rem . Example: SET SearchBrowser FireFox
@Rem . Feature = Search, Attribute = Browser, value = "FireFox"
@Rem . Example: SET Pause On
@Rem . Example: SET PauseZone On
@Rem . Example: SET PauseZonePublic Off
@Rem . 
@Rem . Filenames have this structure:
@Rem . <Feature><FeatureAttribute>(<FeatureAttributeValue> OR <FeatureAttributeState>).CFG
@Rem . Syntax: XXXXX <state> allowing: 
@Rem . Feature, Feature Attribute, Feature Attribute Value or State changing content, 
@Rem . Attribute are settings for a feature, debug settings, custom script segments and
@Rem . can vary within a feature (or module perhaps.)

@Rem . 
@Rem . Features are boolean controlled via various files using these file extensions: 
@Rem . 
@Rem . feature = <feature> exists (old: CFG) (feature or feature + setting)
@Rem .           this is a boolean (exists) value constraining the syntax of SET.
@Rem . 
@Rem . data = <feature> <value> (old: DAT) (can contain values or script)
@Rem .        this is copied onto the live (target) script file.
@Rem . 
@Rem . value = <feature> <setting> allows a <value> to be entered for it.
@Rem .         A preset setting (ie. ON, OFF, Exit etc) may be concurrently 
@Rem .         allowed
@Rem . 
@Rem . live = YOUR extension set in the top of mSet.bat. Therefore: 
@Rem . XXX  = <taregetFile> (this is replaced by either the ".data" file 
@Rem .        or the wrapped (scriptified) <value> from the SET command.)
@Rem .        This is what actually gets executed by the module / application. 
@Rem . 
@Rem . default = <feature> <value> <default> (old: STD) (lets you reset an option)
@Rem .           so this matches ".live" initially and replaces it conditionally. 
@Rem . 
@Rem . last = <feature> <value> (<prev>) (for swapping back after a temporary process) 
@Rem .        Each SET command should copy ".live" to ".last" before proceeding.
@Rem . 
@Rem . original = <feature> <value> (<original>) (old: OLD) (a backup) 
@Rem . 
@Rem . 
@Rem . File name suffixes: 
@Rem . _<Attribute, Setting, Option, etc.> = Belonging to a feature. (_AnyText)
@Rem . 
@Rem . _<featureAttribute> = Text, short legth. 
@Rem . _<featureAttributeValue> = Text, short legth. 
@Rem . 
@Rem . _ON =
@Rem . _OFF =
@Rem . _START = 
@Rem . _END = 
@Rem . _STATE = 
@Rem . _ZERO =
@Rem . _VS_4_1_64 = 
@Rem . etc.
