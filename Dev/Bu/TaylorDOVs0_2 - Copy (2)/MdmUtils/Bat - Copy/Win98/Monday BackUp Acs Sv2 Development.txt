@Rem The target is a directory is on drive Acs2_Bu_Da
@Rem (Drive Letter f:).  The directory is:
@Rem F:\BackUp\Monday\Acs2_Sv2
@Rem

@Rem match the volume label of the drive the source is stored on.
@Rem In other words, a logical drive/partion is created for each
@Rem source, and this relationship:

@Rem
@Rem loosely matches the broad categories of information present on
@Rem the system.
