<P>Yankee Clipper III (c)1997-2005 J.LeVasseur &amp; K.Krupa<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for trying the Yankee Clipper III, (c)1997-2005  J.LeVasseur &amp; K.Krupa. This program is Freeware - therefore
you're Free to try it, and Free to take it off your computer if you don't like it. No guarantees expressed or implied.
I cannot be held responsible for any calamity whatsoever. <BR>
<BR>
That said, on to the description of the program. The Yankee Clipper III (YCIII) is a Windows 9x/NT4.0/ME/2000/2003/XP clipboard
memory/stacker that resides in the system tray. It acts as a silent sentry, continually watching the clipboard,
waiting for a change in the text contents. If a change is detected, YCIII saves a copy of the clipboard contents
in the event you may want to reuse it. Clicking on the little clipboard in the system tray brings the Yankee Clipper
to the top or makes it visible if it was hidden.  Double-clicking on an item in the list, or selecting with the
arrow keys and hitting &lt;Enter&gt; will place that item back in the clipboard. <BR>
<BR>

*************************************************************** <BR>
FREEWARE- this software is free, and says "Freeware" prominently. That is to keep you out of trouble
with your boss. It's not freeware, it's Make_my_day_ware. What in the world is that? Well Make_my_day_ware is software
you can do whatever you want with, with one condition: you have to do something for us. I knew it, you're thinking,
right? What do these two ugly guys want? We want you to do something for us- for example: you find a really neat
website about ancient Egyptian dogs, tell us about in an e-mail and you're "registered" under the concept
of Make_my_day_ware. ( We actually could care less about ancient Egyptian dogs, but would probably get quite a
chuckle out of it.)<BR>
<BR>
Another way to "register" your software is to go home and tell your spouse/child/friend/neighbor that
you care about them. You don't need to tell us that you did it, that's not the point. The point is to do something
to make our day nicer- or someone else's. No fees or registration numbers, you will know if you are registered
or not. On a more practical note, you could also register this software by sending us a big bag of money in the
denomination of your choice. Hey, it was worth a try...<BR>
